prails
======

Prails is a Rails inspired PHP MVC Framework. Instead of bringing a heavyweight
set of classes and assets, this framework is very simple but works just as any other one.
You can start with your own models or you can create your own. Support for MySQL and fixtures
come out of the box. Support for other databases is coming in the near future.

It comes with its own test class to avoid the installation of additional test frameworks. The results
are jUnit compatible if you want to integrate the project with automated builders. Just point your
parser to tests/results and your done.
